<a class="button" href="https://www.facebook.com/p/La-Fabric-de-C%C3%A9dric-100063651157095/?locale=fr_FR">La Fabric de Cédric</a> is a restaurant on Rue D'Auriol in Montauban (82), France. Cédric shared his problem with making cutlery and glasses available during service, being alone he wanted to optimize his table setting. With this idea in mind, he came to see me to design a tool that would allow him to optimize his service.

We naturally proposed a clean pot design that blends with his décor. We designed the project on Fusion 360 and printed the pots in matte PETG from Extrudr which withstands 90°C and is dishwasher safe.

The pots are designed to receive napkins, cutlery and glasses of different diameters so that tables can be set before the rush of customers.

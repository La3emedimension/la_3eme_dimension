3D printing offers many possibilities in terms of shapes, colors and textures. The integration of LEDs with a controller provides a multitude of combinations.

We chose to add an aviator connector to our power supplies, ensuring a stable connection. Additionally, the cable can be customized with paracord, Techflex and heat shrink tubing to match your preferences and style.

We opted for dark colors to highlight our website and logo, as shown in our photos. If you have communication needs or questions, feel free to contact us!

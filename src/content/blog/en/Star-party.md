# La 3eme Dimension at the Gratentour Star Party

Following an astro outing with Nicolas Lacoste and Kamal Moufakir, the organizers of the Gratentour Star Party, I was lucky enough to be invited.

On October 11, meet at the Salle des Fêtes de Gratentour for a day and evening dedicated to astronomy, environment and sky discovery.

## The program:

- **Inflatable planetarium**
- **Creative workshops**
- **Meeting with enthusiasts**
- **Observations**
- **DJ set, food trucks and refreshments**


## And "la 3eme dim" in all this?

- **The Smallest**, a fast and compact telescope developed in collaboration with Gallifrey for the optics (specialist in mirror manufacturing).

- **The ERT**, another of my creations, which illustrates the potential of 3D printing in the design of high-performance, lightweight and accessible optical instruments.

- **Printing on site**, the printer will also be part of it (Star-party?)

The goal: to show how the combination of 3D and craftsmanship opens new perspectives for designing custom projects. See you on October 11!

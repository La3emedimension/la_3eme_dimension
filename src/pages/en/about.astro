			<Hero title="The Origin of the Project">
				<p>La 3ème Dimension was born from an observation: portable telescopes on the market often make frustrating compromises between size and optical quality. I wanted to design an instrument that fits in a backpack, assembles in minutes, and delivers real performance.</p>

				<p>That's how the Smallest was born, a 150/750 Newtonian telescope fully 3D printable. The project has accumulated over 23,000 views on Printables and brings together an active community of builders.</p>

				<p>For uncompromising quality, I offer an assembled and optimized version: removable carbon tubes for even more compact storage, removable counterweights for perfect balance according to your eyepieces, all tested and guaranteed for 2 years.</p>

				<p>My background combines woodworking, industrial design and, since 2016, communication and design. This dual technical and visual expertise guides my approach to design: functional, robust, and refined objects.</p>

				<p>On a daily basis, I support restaurant owners, craftspeople and individuals with their 3D printing needs: spare parts, prototypes, custom solutions.</p>
